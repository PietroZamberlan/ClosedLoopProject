# TODO

## Overview

## General
- [ ] Test

## GP: Gaussian process active learning algorithm
- [ ] Fast estimation of utility: Implementing the inversion of Ktilde (n+1 x n+1) given Ktilde (n x n)
- [ ] Fast computation of the (n+1 x n+1) Kernel given the (n x n) one. Give that we dont learn the hyperparameter this should be fast
- [ ] Profile the bottlenecks
    - [ ] Lambert W function is being handled by the CPU ( it gets copyed every time to the GPU)

## TCP Protocol:
- [x] Implement way o check if the recorded spikes are still influenced by the latest shown image.
- [ ] Implement the parallel showing of Random and Utility driven sets of images.
- [ ] Implement a control to double check th enumber of received triggers ( mean time between triggers )

## Visualization tools - Experimental checks
- [ ] Is the trigger chanel noise level as stable as we hope? This influences the difference threshold for trigger detection
- [ ] Visualize the average spike waveform of the selected unit generated by the latest 10 spikes. Compare that with the average over the previous ones.

## DMD:
- [ ] Implement run_DMD.py script on Windows machine to automate the use of film.exe compiled executable to present DMD images
- [ ] Make the above faster by reducing the size of images, the number of loaded frames etc
